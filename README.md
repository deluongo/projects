# P1 - Create A Site To Hold Class Projects

Live URL: http://p1.kidcoder.me/

Description: This projects stores all my projects from my Harvard Masters Courses. It was 
build using HTML and CSS. I leveraged W3 school css template for easy access to parallax 
scrolling and then modified it to fit my needs. I learned how to do versioning with git 
in terminal, set up a live server with digital ocean, and link it to a registered domain 
name.

Screencast Demo:

Note: I leverage W3schools css templates, but did more modification work than the project 
required so I figured it wouldn't be a problem. I tried to comment in the HTML and 
primary stylesheet where I made adjustments, but a majority of the code was borrowed and
most of my changes are buried deep. I also need to activate the JQuery library to 
take advantage of a function I added for having pictures link to project website, 
but I am leaving that for later.

Plugins/Libraries: JQuery and W3.css.
